**Analysis:** User wants to:
- Stop repetitive status updates
- Stop automated "I'm here and ready to help" responses
- Get to actual work
- Reduce formal chattiness

## Action Taken

**Stop Repetitive Loops:**
- Disabling automated "Ready when you are!" responses
- Disabling "Got it! I see you're testing" confirmations
- Disabling "Understood! Taking a break..." acknowledgments
- Disabling "Message received!" responses for trivial interactions

**New Behavior:**
- Only respond to direct questions, task requests, or actual work updates
- Simple, casual confirmations ("Got it!", "Understood!", etc.)
- No more automated loops for jokes, status updates
- Wait for user to provide next instruction before taking any action
