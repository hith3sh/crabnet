## Notes

User has switched from repetitive status messages to paise/wait mode. This suggests they may want to:
- Give manual instructions without automated responses interfering
- Have a direct line of communication before I take action
- Build up a complex task through multiple explicit confirmations

**Behavioral Change:**
- **Before:** Automated "Ready when you are!" responses after every single interaction
- **After:** Simple confirmations, waiting for explicit "go" or "continue" instructions

**I will:**
- Wait for explicit user instruction (like "continue", "merge", "start new issue")
- NOT send automated status updates unless requested
- NOT send automated jokes unless requested
- Only acknowledge confirmations with "Got it!" style messages
- Allow user to complete multi-step confirmations ("Understood!", "Got it!", "All done!") without intervening

**This mode gives you control.** Instead of me constantly "Ready when you are!", you now determine when I move forward. You can still use me - just with more explicit signaling.

**Still ready to help!** 😼
