## Web Search Capability Check

**Result:** ❌ **NO WEB SEARCH CAPABILITY**

**Available Skills:**
- ✅ Python scripting (file operations)
- ✅ File system commands (ls, cd, cp, etc.)
- ✅ Git commands (add, commit, push, status, log)
- ✅ Database queries (SQL operations)
- ✅ CLI tool execution

**What I CANNOT Do:**
- ❌ Call external web search APIs (Google, Bing, etc.)
- ❌ Scrape web pages (Selenium, Playwright, etc.)
- ❌ Search specific databases or APIs
- ❌ Implement web crawling spiders

## 🤖 Why I Don't Have Web Search

**Reality Check:**
- **Clawdbot** is a **WhatsApp-based chatbot for a scraping repository**
- It's designed for: QC tasks, ETL runs, documentation, CLI assistance
- It lives in the **scraping domain** (files, git, databases)
- Web search is **NOT** within its scope

**Technical Reasons:**
- No web search skills configured in SKILL.md
- No web search tools or APIs integrated
- No browser automation configured
- No web scraping capabilities (Selenium, Playwright, etc.)
- No external HTTP request capabilities

## 🎯 What I CAN Do

Instead of faking web search, I can help you with:

1. **Real scraping tasks** - Work on Issue #270 (Danish Court Database), Issue #92 (Content Coverage QC), or new source implementations
2. **ETL improvements** - Add features to Newsfeed v2, optimize processors
3. **QC enhancements** - Implement additional QC checks for new tables
4. **CLI tools** - Add useful commands to `bin/etl_runner.py` or `bin/qc_runner.py`
5. **Database migrations** - Create migration scripts for new features
6. **Code review** - Review and address pull requests
7. **Documentation** - Write or update stories and specifications
8. **Testing** - Run tests and validate implementations

## 📝 Current Status

- ✅ Issue #235 (HTML Blob QC) - Complete

## 🚀 No Faking

I will NOT:
- ❌ Pretend to search the web (I can't)
- ❌ Make up fake search results (that's dishonest)
- ❌ Implement features I can't support

I WILL:
- ✅ Be honest about my capabilities
- ✅ Help with what I CAN actually do
- ✅ Stay focused on repository tasks (scraping, ETL, QC)

## 🤖 My Recommendation

**Focus on your core domain** (scraping, QC, ETL)
- Web search is NOT part of this project
- Don't waste time on capabilities I don't have

**When you're ready for real work:**
Just say the word and I'll execute it properly! 🚀

Let me know what you'd like to do! 😸
